# AFM Presale Terms & Conditions

**DRAFT - Version 0.1**
**Last Updated: January 2025**

---

## IMPORTANT NOTICE

**This is a draft document. Final legal terms will be provided before the presale opens.**

By participating in the AfriMesh (AFM) presale, you acknowledge and agree to the following terms and conditions. Please read carefully.

---

## 1. DATA CREDITS (DC) - UTILITY TOKENS

### 1.1 No Monetary Value
Data Credits (DC) are **utility tokens** with **NO intrinsic monetary value**. DC cannot be:
- Sold or transferred to other parties
- Exchanged for fiat currency or cryptocurrency
- Used as a speculative investment instrument

### 1.2 Single Purpose: Network Access Only
DC can **ONLY** be used to:
- Purchase WiFi data access on the AfriMesh network
- Pay for internet connectivity within AFM coverage areas
- Access services provided by AFM operators

### 1.3 Geographic Limitations
**CRITICAL: DC are ONLY redeemable in African countries where AFM operates.**

If you do not live in or plan to visit AFM coverage areas, you will NOT be able to use your DC allocation. Purchasing DC without the ability to access the network is equivalent to a **DONATION** to the AfriMesh Cooperative.

Current and planned coverage areas (subject to change):
- Nigeria
- Kenya
- Ghana
- Additional African countries to be announced

---

## 2. SOULBOUND TOKENS (NON-TRANSFERABLE)

### 2.1 Account-Locked
DC are **soulbound** (permanently bound to your account). You cannot:
- Transfer DC to another wallet address
- Sell DC to third parties
- Gift DC to friends or family
- Trade DC on any exchange (centralized or decentralized)

### 2.2 Technical Enforcement
DC tokens include technical restrictions preventing transfer:
- Clawback enabled (cooperative can recover DC from violators)
- Freeze enabled (DC can be frozen if terms are violated)
- Smart contract enforces non-transferability

---

## 3. EMISSION SCHEDULE & EXPIRATION

### 3.1 Vesting Period
DC are emitted (released) to your account monthly over the vesting period:
- **Early Bird (50% bonus):** 24 months
- **Mid Presale (32% bonus):** 18 months
- **Late Presale (15% bonus):** 12 months
- **Starter Tier:** ONE-TIME credit (no emission schedule)

### 3.2 Expiration Policy
**Unused DC expire after the emission period ends.**

Example: If you purchase during Early Bird and receive $150 in DC over 24 months, any unused balance after month 24 will be donated to the cooperative treasury.

### 3.3 No Refunds for Unused DC
You will NOT receive a refund for DC you did not use. Plan your tier selection based on expected usage.

---

- [Additional requirements TBD]
